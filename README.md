This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which will panic when executed.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses safe indexing techniques to avoid this issue. This is a crucial concept to understand when working with vectors and other collections in Rust to ensure memory safety and program stability.
